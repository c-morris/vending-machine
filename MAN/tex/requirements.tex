\section{Scenario and Requirements} 

We are tasked to design the internal logic of a vending machine for the NSA who wishes to sell high quality entropy to the general public on flash drives. The flash drives may or may not also spy on us, but that is not our concern. We just make the circuits to run the machines that sell them. \\

The machine is to accept only U.S. bills as input and dispense only bills as change. This is to make transactions more convenient for users and also to limit the complexity of the change dispensing logic. The machine will keep an inventory of how many flash drives remain in it and turn on an indicator light to indicate when it has run out of them. The machine will also display the amount of money that users put into it. The maximum number of dollars that can be put in the machine at once is \$63 because it is stored using six bits of memory. This should not be a problem because the highest priced item for sale by the machine is \$12. If inflation becomes bad enough that the price of this item rises to \$64 before these machines are retired then we will have bigger problems than our vending machines not working. \\

The items and their prices are listed in the table below. 

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Product} & \textbf{Price} \\ 
\hline 
Entropy from Measured Quantum Phenomena  & \$12 \\ 
\hline 
Entropy from Monkies on Typewriters & \$7 \\ 
\hline 
Entropy from Car Horns in New York City & \$4 \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular}

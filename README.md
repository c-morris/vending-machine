# Vending Machine
Vending machine project for UConn Digital Logic Design Course (CSE 2300W)

## Steps
1. Decide on who our imaginary customer will be and what their requirements are
2. Specify what our product will do. 
3. Choose the currency that our machine will accept (e.g. coins, bills, USD,
GBP, BTC).
4. Divide labor and provide specifications on how the individual parts will interact.
5. Design and test in LogicWorks.
6. Build and test circuits on protoboards.
7. Profit.

## Design Considerations
- Handling change
- Errors and warnings
    - Out of product
    - Out of change
- We can be creative

## Other Notes
- We need to write a manual.
- We need to write a report.
    - It should describe the customer, solution, design philosophy, testing, results, division of labor, suggestions for future work, and above all it should demonstrate what we learned during the project.
- We need to have real meetings and keep meeting minutes.
- KB said that humor is welcome in this project.
